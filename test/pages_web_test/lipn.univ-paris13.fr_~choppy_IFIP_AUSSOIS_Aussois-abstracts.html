<BR>[Joint work with] Hartmut Ehrig,  Ulrike Golas, Frank Hermann<BR><I>Abstract: </I><BR>Graph transformation systems (GTS) have been proposed for high-level stochastic modelling of dynamic systems and networks. The resulting systems can be described as semi-Markov processes with graphs as states and transformations as transitions.
<BR><BR>
The operational semantics of such processes can be explored through stochastic simulations. In this talk we develop the basic theory of stochastic graph transformation, including generalisations of the Local Church-Rosser, Parallelism and Concurrency Theorems and their application to computing the completion time of a concurrent process.

<BR>[Joint work with] Grzegorz Marczynski, Martin Wirsing, and Artur Zawlocki<BR><I>Abstract: </I><BR>
Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a relatively new approach to software system development. It divides system functionality to independent, loosely coupled, interoperable services. In this paper we propose a new heterogeneous specification approach for SOA systems where a heterogeneous structured specification consists of a number of specifications of individual services written in a "local" logic and where the specification of their interactions is separately described in a "global" logic. A main feature of our global logic is the possibility of describing the dynamic change of service communications over time. Our approach is based on the theory of institutions: we show that both logics form institutions and that these institutions are connected by an institution comorphism. We illustrate our approach by a simple scenario of an e-university management system and show the power of the heterogeneous specification approach by a compositional refinement of the scenario.

<BR>[Joint work with] Sergey Goncharov<BR><I>Abstract: </I><BR>Both in semantic theory and in programming practice, algebraic
concepts such as monads or, essentially equivalently, (large)
Lawvere theories are a well-established tool for modelling generic
side-effects. An important issue in this context are combination
mechanisms for such algebraic effects, which allow for the modular
design of programming languages and verification logics. The most
basic combination operators are sum and tensor: while the sum of
effects is just their non-interacting union, the tensor imposes
commutation of effects. However, for effects with unbounded arity,
such as continuations or unbounded non-determinism, it is not a
priori clear whether these combinations actually exist in all
cases. Here, we introduce the class of uniform effects, which
includes unbounded non-determinism and continuations, and prove that
the tensor does always exist if one of the component effects is
uniform, thus in particular improving on previous results on
tensoring with continuations. We then treat the case of (unbounded)
non-determinism in more detail, and give an order-theoretic
characterization of effects for which tensoring with non-determinism
is conservative, thus enabling non-deterministic arguments for
deterministic programs such as a generic version of the
Fisher-Ladner encoding of control operators.

<BR>[Joint work with] Antonia Lopes<BR><I>Abstract: </I><BR>
We revisit the notions of interface and component algebra proposed by de Alfaro and Henzinger for component-based design and put forward elements of a corresponding interface theory for service-oriented design. We view services as a layer that can be added over a component infrastructure and propose a notion of service interface for a component algebra that is an asynchronous version of relational nets adapted to SCA (the Service Component Architecture developed by the Open Service-Oriented Architecture collaboration).

<BR>[Joint work with] Jean-Guillaume Dumas, Laurent Fousse and Jean-Claude Reynaud<BR><I>Abstract: </I><BR>
This talk is about the semantics of programming languages,
more precisely the semantics of two computational effects:
states and exceptions.<BR>
Effects can be formalized thanks to monads [Moggi 1989]
or Lawvere theories [Plotkin Power 2001],
however in this talk we rather use decorated specifications
[Duval Lair Reynaud 2003].<BR>
First we present decorated specifications as a generalization of monads
and we give a motivating object-oriented example. 
Then we build a decorated specification for states and one for exceptions.
<BR>This yields 
a new point of view on states,
a new categorical formalization of exceptions with handling,
and an unexpected duality between states and exceptions.

properties which can be observed through interaction depend heavily
upon their mode
of communication. A typical approach to describing the semantics of
communicating
processes is to provide a labelled transition system (LTS) which
captures the interaction
potential of the individual processes within a larger system.
<BR><BR>
In many cases, a natural rendering of this lts leads to too \ufb01ne a
semantics as unobservability
of certain communications is not accounted for. We propose that a
standard approach to
augmenting LTSs allows morally unobservable communications to actually
be modelled as
unobservables in the semantics. This approach derives from a rule
initially given by Honda
and Tokoro to account for unobservability of reception in the
asynchronous pi-calculus. We
will examine the implications of adding such rules to lts with respect
to the proving behavioural
equivalences for various synchronisation mechanisms.

<BR>[Joint work with] Julien Brunel, Christophe Chareton<BR><I>Abstract: </I><BR>
We report on an on-going project regarding the definition of a formal language for requirements engineering (RE). This language can be seen as a combination of the formal part of the KAOS language, but considering agents as first-class objects as in the Tropos approach. To consider both goals and agents, the semantics is based upon the multi-agent temporal logic ATL. This apporach enables to consider formally the question of the assignment of actors (available or pre-existing agents) to roles (agents needed to fulfill the goals).

<BR>[Joint work with] Pietro Cenciarelli, Eleonora Sibilio<BR><I>Abstract: </I><BR>A semantics to a small fragment of Java capturing the new memory model (JMM) described in the Language Specification is given by combining operational, denotational and axiomatic techniques in a novel semantic framework. The operational steps (specified in the form of SOS) construct denotational models (stable configuration structures) and are constrained by the axioms of a configuration theory. The semantics is proven correct with respect to the Language Specification and shown to capture many common examples in the JMM literature.

semantics of specifications built using some collection of
specification-building operations. As a typical example we consider
the structured specifications built from flat specifications using
union, translation and hiding. For such specifications we have the
standard compositional proof system, which determines the standard
property-oriented semantics assigning a theory to each structured
specification. It is not complete (unless the underlying logic has
interpolation and enjoys some other technical properties) but
otherwise it is "as good as can be expected". In particular, it is
sound, monotone (and hence compositional) and one-step complete. The
last property means that the semantics (and the corresponding proof
system) allows us to deduce all true consequences for specifications
built by applying any specification-building operation to argument
specifications, assuming that there is no discrepancy between the
classes of models of the argument specifications and the classes of
models of their respective property-oriented meanings. This is a
strong property which was believed to ensure that the semantics is "as
strong as possible" without loosing soundness or compositionality. We
question this claim and show that it holds assuming in addition that
the semantics considered are not "absent-minded", i.e., do not loose
axioms of flat specifications. We sketch an example to show that by
excluding deduction of some axioms in flat specifications we may offer
a stronger rule for natural specification-building operation so that
for some specifications the resulting semantics is stronger than the
standard one.

<BR>[Joint work with] Serge Autexier, Dominique Dietrich, and Dieter Hutter<BR><I>Abstract: </I><BR>
The error-prone process of formal specification and verification of
 large systems requires an efficient, evolutionary formal development
 approach.  Development graphs have been designed to support such an
 approach. They can formally represent the actual state of a
 software development comprising specification and verification work
 in a structured way and assist the user in her evolutionary
 development by the incorporated change management support.  In this
 paper we extend this work with respect to heterogeneous development
 graphs allowing one to make use of different institutions,
 i.e. logics, for specifying and verifying large developments. We
 also push forward the idea of stringent locality of definitions by
 introducing pre-signatures and pre-signature morphisms, which allow
 us to build up signatures in an incremental and parametric way.</LI><BR>------------------------------------------------------

<BR><I>Abstract: </I><BR>
First I will show how a simple categorical understanding of detereministic automata in the spirit of Arbib and Manes, when instantiated in the category of nominal sets as stued by Gabbay and Pitts, yields a useful model of finite computation on infinite alpabets, closely related to HD-automata of Pistore and others, and enjoying better properties then Finite Memory Automata of Francez and Kaminski. These are then generalized to cater for alphabets with structure (such as an order or a graph) that can be checked upon by automata. In the process, the theory of nominal sets needs to be generalized to arbitrary groups of permutations rather than symmetric groups. A particularly well behaved class of alphabets arises from the model-theoretic study of Fraisse limits.</LI><BR>------------------------------------------------------
