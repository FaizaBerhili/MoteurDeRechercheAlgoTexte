<BR>Algebraic simulations   	
(<A HREF="BRAGA-DATA/MartiOliet-ifip07-algebraic-sim.pdf">slides</A>)
<BR>(joint work with Jose Meseguer and Miguel Palomino)
<BR><BR>
In the first part of the talk we describe generalizations of
simulations in threedirections. First, by avoiding negation we relax
the condition on preservationof atomic properties from equality to
containment; second, we considerstuttering simulations, which are
useful to relate concurrent systems withdifferent levels of
atomicity; third, we allow different alphabets AP and AP' ofatomic
propositions so that an atomic proposition in AP is mapped to a
stateformula over AP'.  A categorical viewpoint is the most natural
to understandand organize these generalized simulations.
<BR><BR>
In the second part of the talk we prove several representability
resultsshowing that any Kripke structure can be represented by a
rewrite theory,and that any generalized simulation can be represented
by a rewrite relation.We consider four increasingly more general ways
of defining simulationsin rewriting logic: equational abstractions,
theory interpretations, simulationmaps as equationally defined
functions, and simulations given by rewriterelations. The first two
techniques have been studied in detail in previouspapers. The third
one is illustrated here by means of an example showingthat a stack
machine correctly implements the operational semantics for asimple
functional language. The fourth one is also illustrated by means ofa
communication protocol example proving in-order delivery of messages
inthe presence of an unreliable medium.

<BR>Modular construction of symbolic observation graph
<BR>(joint work with Kais Klai)
<BR><BR>
Model checking for Linear Time Logic (LTL) is usually based
onconverting the property into a Buchi automaton (or
tableau),composing the automaton and the model, and finally checking
foremptiness of the language of the composed system. The last step
isthe crucial stage of the verification process because of the
stateexplosion problem, i.e. the exponential increase of the
numberof states w.r.t. the number of system components. 
<BR>
In thiswork,
we present a symbolic and modular solution which builds, in a
modularway, an observation graph represented in a non-symbolic way
but where thenodes are essentially symbolic sets of states and the
edges either labelled byevents occurring in the formula or by
synchronisation actions between thesystem components. Due to the
small number of events to be observed in atypical formula, this graph
has a very moderate size and thus the complexitytime of verification
is negligible w.r.t. the time to build the observationgraph. 
<BR>
The preliminary evaluations we have achieved on standard examples
showthat our method outperforms both a non modular generation of the
symbolicgraph and the pure symbolic methods.

<BR>Uniform random sampling of traces in very large models
<BR>(joint work with Alain Denise, Sandrine-Dominique Gouraud, 
Richard Lassaigne, Sylvain Peyronnet)
<BR><BR>
This talk presents some first results on how to perform uniformrandom
walks (where every trace has the same probability to occur) invery
large models.  The models considered here are described in asuccinct
way as a set of communicating reactive modules.  The methodrelies
upon techniques for counting and drawing uniformly at randomwords in
regular languages.  Each module is considered as an automatondefining
such a language.  It is shown how it is possible to combinelocal
uniform drawings of traces, and to obtain some global uniformrandom
sampling, without construction of the global model.

<BR>A model checking approach for designing asynchronous extension of SOAP
<BR>(joint work with Maurice ter Beek, and Franco Mazzanti)
<BR><BR>
In this talk an action-state based logical framework for the analysis
andverification of complex systems that relies on the definition of
doublylabeled transition systems. The defined logic combines the
actionparadigm, classically used for describing systems using
labeledtransitions systems together with the predicates that are true
overstates as captured using Kripke structures as semantic model.An
efficient model checker for this logic has been realized exploiting
anon the fly algorithm. In the end of the talk the use of the logic
andits model checker in the design phase of an asynchronous extension
ofSOAP is shown.

<BR>Generic developments
<BR>(joint work with Dominique Cansell)
<BR><BR>
Proof-oriented system development  aims to reinforce standard  methods
for the   design of computer-based systems  through  formal description and
analysis  techniques   that  can help   to   ensure  higher  levels of
reliability   and correctness.      Based on  a   precise mathematical
semantics, it offers     powerful techniques for  the  validation  and
analysis   of system   models,  including  comprehensive  testing  and
verification that accompany and   guide the development process.   We
focus  on  the  security  of information  systems,  trustworthy system
functionality  and   the  validation   and   verification  (and  their
communication) of security   and   trustworthiness;   we   consider
distributed algorithms  as    a class  of  systems to     develop in a
proof-based way.  We aim to justify confidence of measures in security
of information systems and trustworthy system functionality though the
concept of refinement.
<BR><BR>
The design  of systems of realistic scale  requires models to be built
at different levels of abstraction and detail. In a formal approach to
system development, these  models are related   by the key concept  of
\emph{refinement},  which ensures  that  properties established at  an
abstract level are   preserved by the implementation.  The  refinement
relationship between  system   specifications   is established   by  a
rigorous \emph{proof} showing that the class of models of the concrete
specification is contained in the class of models of the abstract one.
<BR><BR>
The benefits of an approach based on refinement are numerous: from the
point  of  view of  the  system developer, system requirements  can be
addressed  in  several steps (or  cycles)   of system development, and
feedback  on the properties  of the current  model of the system or on
design errors is  obtained quite early. From  the point of view of the
verifier, the burden of proof is spread  over the development process,
and the preservation  of  key properties such  as safety,  security or
availability is guaranteed. The presence of intermediate system models
both reduces  the complexity of the proof  obligations (allowing for a
higher degree  of automation) and  produces a trace  of \textit{ milestones}
 during the development of a system, documenting the design
<BR><BR>
The overall goal of a proof-oriented development process for improving
the quality of computer-based systems translates into a number of
individual key challenges along which our progress should be measured:
<BR>
- integrate proof techniques in the development process,
<BR>- apply refinement throughout the development process, from the
  elaboration of the requirements to obtaining efficient code.
<BR>- combine certified components through refinement and genericity,
<BR>- provide proven  methodological guides  validated by proof process, 
namely proof-based design patterns
<BR>- validate the approach through  realistic  case studies, with emphasis 
on distributed systems and algorithms  for system engineering 
<BR><BR>
The talk focuses on  the \textit{refinement} of event-based models and
aims to  develop new features related  to the refinement,  such as the
re-usability  of  refinement-based  development,  the  definition   of
proof-based design patterns  and the   development of case    studies,
especially  related to  distributed   systems. We  intend  to  develop
specific proof-based  patterns from case   studies to generalize  into
objects called   generic developments.  We  illustrate applications by
replaying developments for greedy algorithms.

<BR>Revisiting invariants
<BR>(joint work with JosÈ N. Oliveira and Alexandra Silva )
<BR><BR>
We discuss the usefulness of reasoning about invariants for
softwarecomponentscoalgebraically in the allegory of binary
relations.
<BR>
The novelty of our approach consists in establishing a
synergy betweena relational construct, Reynolds' «relation on
functions» involved inhis abstraction theorem (traditionally employed
in explaining and reasoningabout parametric polymorphism),and the
coalgebraic approach to bisimulations and invariants.
<BR><BR>
This synergy arises from the fact that, once
pointfree-transformed,formulae in one domain «look like» others in
the other domain.We stress on this syntactic aspect of formal
reasoning,a kind of "let-the-symbols-do-the-work" style of
calculation, often neglectedby too much emphasis on domain-specific,
semantic concerns.

<BR>A semantic PSPACE criterion for coalgebraic modal logic
<BR><BR>
Upper complexity bounds for modal logics are often an intricate issue
treated with a wide range of frequently ad-hoc techniques. As
domain-specific modal logics (often non-normal) abound in the literature
and new ones appear at regular intervals, it is therefore desirable to
develop a generic algorithmic framework for deriving such bounds
systematically. Here, we present a semantics-based criterion for modal
logics whose axioms do not nest modal operators to be decidable in
PSPACE, typically a tight upper bound; the generality of our
approach is based on a coalgebraic semantics. This result complements an
earlier tableau-based method and extends the class of logics covered by
generic techniques. In some cases, e.g. conditional logics, the
semantic criterion is established very easily, and in others, notably
various logics of quantitative uncertainty, it follows by dissecting
off-the-shelf results. Thus, our method allows establishing
PSPACE-completeness of a wide range of logics with only moderate
effort.

<BR>A characterisation of modal logics of rank 1
<BR>(joint work with J. Rosicky)
<BR><BR>
We show that a functor on a variety has a finitary presentation by
operationsand equations if and only if this functor preserves sifted
colimits. Moreover,from the proof it follows that this presentation
is by equations of rank 1 (anequation is of rank 1 if each variable
is in the scope of precisely one modaloperator). We also remark that
on the variety of Boolean algebras siftedcolimit preserving functors
and filtered colimit preserving functors (almost)coincide.

<BR>CSP-Prover 
<BR>(joint work with Yoshinao Isobe)
<BR><BR>
In this talk, we discuss the generic architecture of the tool
CSP-Prover, some of its applications, and first steps towards
extending it to a CSP-CASL prover.
<BR><BR>
CSP-Prover was first introduced at TACAS 2005. 
It provides a generic interactive theorem proving environment for the
process algebra CSP. The tool is based on the theorem prover
Isabelle. Our 
<A HREF="http://staff.aist.go.jp/y-isobe/CSP-Prover/CSP-Prover.html">Web-Page</A>
provides some sample case studies of theoretical and of industrial 
nature.
<BR><BR>
With the help of CSP-Prover we developed and verified the first
complete axiomatic semantics for the CSP stable failures model (see
CONCUR 2006). The proof involves sequentialisation and normalization
of processes, also a new normal form needs to be introduced.
<BR><BR>
Finally, we show how to combine CSP-Prover with the CASL tool Hets in
order to obtain a CSP-CASL prover. First experiments with carefully
selected examples demonstrated that the approach to be feasable.

<BR>A formal foundation for contract-based software components
<BR>(joint work with Rolf HENNICKER)
<BR><BR>
We propose a rigorous formal foundation for contract-based
software components used in sequential systems. Our approach
is abstract in the sense that it focuses on the general
characteristic aspects of components, like hiding of component
implementations by means of provided and required interfaces,
and thus can be reused for the semantical foundation of
concrete component models incorporating contracts.
<BR><BR>
In our framework contracts are represented by interface
specifications containing a distinguished set of ``observers'' that
are used to specify, from the user's point of view,
observable invariants of an interface as well as application
conditions and observable effects of the interface methods.
<BR><BR>
Semantically, we adopt classical concepts of mathematical logic
using models, in our framework given by labelled transition systems
with ``states as algebras'', sentences, given by invariants and
behaviour specifications of methods, and a satisfaction relation
which characterizes the observable properties of models.
Intuitively, a component is ``correct'' if its implementation respects
its provided interface specification (for any correct realization of the
component's required interface). On the given semantical
basis this correctness notion can be easily formalized by requiring
that the component implementation induces a transition system
(for any model of the required interface specification) which is also
a model of the provided interface specification of the component.

(Towards) An institution for graph transformation
<BR><BR>
Institutions are a powerful formalism relating to the <em>Abstract
ModelTheory for Specification and Programming</em>, as the title of
the seminalwork by Burstall and Goguen states. The DPO approach to
rewriting pursues asimilar aim with respect to "abstraction", since
it recasts the classicalingredients of rewriting (rules and their
application, substitutions, and soon) in a general categorical
formalism.
<BR><BR>
After revising the standard theories for the institution of algebraic
specifications and of term rewriting systems, the talk introduces two
alternatives proposals (based on multi-algebras and monoidal
categories,respectively) for providing an institution to DPO
transformation systemsbased on various graph-like structures. These
proposals are then compared,and their relative meritsdiscussed.

<BR>Heterogeneous proof scripts
<BR><BR>
The heterogeneous tool set integrates various languages, logics
andproof tools. So far, proof management has been session based,
usinga graphical user interface. A proof script language (like the
onesused by current interactive theorem provers) has the
advantagethat proof developments are made explicit and can be re-used
forlater developments. We introduce such as proof script language
forHets. It combines proof commands for the structured level
(usingthe development graph calculus) with local theorem provers
forspecific logics. Proof scripts for the latter can be embedded
intothe scripts for Hets, such that we arrive at heterogeneous
proofscripts.

<BR>Eating, or: programmming with bi-inductive types
<BR>(joint work with P. Hankock and N. Ghani)
<BR><BR>
We define representations of continuous functions
on infinite streams of discrete values, both in the case of
discrete-valued functions, and in the case of stream-valued
functions.  We define also an operation of the representations of
two continuous functions between streams that yields a
representation of their composite.
<BR><BR>
In the case of discrete-valued functions, the representatives are
well-founded (finite-path) trees of a certain kind. The underlying
idea can be traced back to Brouwer's justification of bar-induction, or
to Kreisel and Troelstra's elimination of choice-sequences.
In the case of stream-valued functions, the representatives are
non-wellfounded trees pieced together in a coinductive fashion from
well-founded trees.  The definition requires an alternating fixpoint
construction of some interest.
<BR><BR>
In neither case are the representatives unique.
There may be many distinct representatives of extensionally the same
function. Nevertheless, the distinctions between them capture
genuine differences in computational behaviour.
<BR><BR>
These representations (the data structures and their decoding
functions) have a simple (if imperfect) expression in a functional
programming language such as Haskell.

<BR>Compositionality, and independence in automata
<BR>(joint work with RFC Walters)
<BR><BR>
The main goal of our work is to build nets of systems (automata)
 communicating through interfaces with the following characteristics:
<BR> spatial distribution
<BR> compositionality
<BR> changing topology (connections/components)
<BR> hierarchy
<BR>and hence
<BR>Models of distributed complex systems.
<BR><BR>
In this lecture I discuss the investigation of the notion of
independence of actions, in distributed systems, where
the independence varies over time.
<BR><BR>
The classical automata model for analysing independence is that
of Asynchronous Automata. This model has two defects:
<BR>i) it is not compositional (the separate "automata" making up
an asynchronous automaton do not in fact exist separately as
automata but just as statespaces),
<BR>ii) the independence relation is fixed.
<BR><BR>
I describe first how this non-compositional model may be made
compositional in the context of spans of graphs.
<BR><BR>
This suggests a definition of independence of actions in the more
general setting of Span(Graph) - actions are independent if they
are performed by different (parallel) subautomata, and when they are performed
performed there is no non-trivial communication between
these subautomata.
<BR><BR>
I then introduce Cospans of graphs to model reconfiguration of
networks of automata. With the algebra of spans and cospans
of graphs we analyse a classical example of varying independence,
namely the Producer-Consumer Problem.

<BR>On compositionality for automata: (i) infinite states and (ii) morphisms
<BR>(joint work with M. Menni and N Sabadini)
<BR><BR>
Compositionality
<BR><BR>
Consider a category E of ?state spaces? of systems.
(For example, Graphs.) We are interested in building systems
from parts.
The usual operations are:
<BR>    limits (parallel)
<BR>    colimits (sequential).
<BR><BR>
With these operations a system is presented as a
graph-shaped diagram of parts(wysiwig, goto, geometric).
<BR><BR>
Compositionality means instead an algebra in which systems
are represented as expressions. Systems are put together using
meaningful operations, giving a hierarchical structure.
<BR><BR>
We have a proposal for an abstract algebra for both finite
limits and finite colimits, namely the well-supported compact
closed structures of Spans(E) and Cospans(E). The reason is that
Cospans(finite diagrams in E) is the free wscc category on the
underlying graph of E, and limit: Cospans(diagrams)->Span(E)
and colimit:Cospans(diagrams)->Cospan(E) are wscc functors.
<BR><BR>
(i) Infinite State systems with finite control
<BR><BR>
We give an examples of
structures with finite control,including Turing machines,
which may be expressed compositionally in this way.
<BR><BR>
A useful fact is that extensive categories with products have
pullbacks with codomain a finite sum of terminals. The category
of functions computable by straight-line programs from some data
types is such a category.
<BR><BR>
(ii) Morphisms
The above discussion of compositionality refers to the composition
of systems but not to their morphisms, which rquires understanding
better the monoidal bi-category structure of cospans.
As a first step in that investigation we prove a universal
property of the monoidal 2-category of cospans of finite linear
orders and surjections. This involves a 2-dimensional generalization
of the notion of Frobenius algebra.

<BR>A Bayesian model for event-based trust
<BR>(based on joint work with K. Krukow and M. Nielsen)
<BR><BR>
We focus on systems where trust in a computational entity
isinterpreted astheexpectation of certain future behaviour based on
behavioural patterns of thepast, and concern ourselves with the
foundations of such probabilisticsystems. In particular, we aim
atestablishingformal probabilistic models for computational trust
and their fundamentalproperties. We define a mathematical measure for
quantitatively comparing theeffectiveness of probabilistic
computational trust systems in variousenvironments. With this
foundation in place, we formalise a general notion ofinformation
about past behaviour, based on event structures. This yields a
flexible trust model where the probability of complex protocol
outcomes canbeassessed.

<BR>Style-Based Reconfigurations of Software Architectures as Term Rewriting
<BR>(joint work with Roberto Bruni, Alberto Lluch Lafuente, Pisa
and Emilio Tuosto, Leicester)
<BR><BR>
We present a graph-based approach to deal with the designof
reconfigurable software architectures. The key featureswe promote
are: (i) hierarchical design; (ii) soft constraintsfor modeling QoS
attributes; (iii) style-preserving reconfigurations;(iv) rule-based
approach; and (v) algebraic presentation.Roughly, actual
architectures are modeled bygraphs with port and attribute nodes
through which componentedges are connected. Uniformly, QoS
constraintson attributes are also modeled as edges. Architectures
aredesigned hierarchically by a set of edge replacement rulesthat
fix the architectural style. Depending on their reading,productions
allow: (i) top-down design by refinement, (ii)bottom-up typing, and
(iii) algebraic composition of typedarchitectures, with terms
corresponding to style proofs. Moreover,productions exploit
constraint primitives that can beused in the refinement phase, e.g.,
to reserve a certain amountof resources or to postpone architectural
decisions. Similarly,reconfigurations are modeled as graph
transformationstriggered by constraints primitives to guarantee that
certainlevels of QoS are mantained. The main contributionis showing
that we can take advantage by exploiting styleswhen specifying
reconfigurations: (i) by giving hierarchicalspecifications that
exploit the classes introduced by thestyle, (ii) by guaranteeing that
all reconfigurations are style-preserving,(iii) by expressing
reconfigurations as ordinaryterm rewrite rules on the algebra of
style proofs. Overall,this results in a simple and formal mechanism
for designingarchitectures according to a style, for checking that
anarchitecture is an instance of a style and for ensuring
stylepreservation during reconfigurations.
