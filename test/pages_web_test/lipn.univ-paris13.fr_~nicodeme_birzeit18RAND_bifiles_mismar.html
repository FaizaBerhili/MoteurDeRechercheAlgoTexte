<font color=red>"Finding The Optimal Solution of The Assignment Problems Using probabilities and without Any Iteration"</font>
</li>
I propose a new technique for solving the assignment problems. 
I will explain a new method for solving the balanced assignment
problem. This method is based on building a new matrix from the given cost matrix which I call the probability matrix. This can be done by calculating the expected value in the probability matrix for each in the given cost matrix, then using the two matrices I can obtain the optimal solution directly without any iteration. To show the efficiency of this method I'll consider some numerical examples.
