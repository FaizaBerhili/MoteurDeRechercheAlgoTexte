Markov chains and martingales are powerful tools to study random structures such as trees or urns. Being able to recognise and study such probabilistic 
objects is a great help to the understanding of many stochastic
models.
<p>
The aim of this lecture is to recall definitions of Markov chains and martingales in discrete and continuous time and results concerning them: we will 
especially focus on convergence theorems.
</p>
<p>
Throughout the lecture, we will show how to use those results to study 
random discrete structures, mainly trees and urns. We will see for example that 
a simple random walk is a Markov chain, that the profile of a random binary 
search tree can be encoded by a martingale or that a P&oacute;lya urns process hides 
converging martingales.
